# Tree Sort
Tree sort is a sorting algorithm that is based on Binary Search Tree data structure. It first creates a binary search tree from the elements of the input list or array and then performs an in-order traversal on the created binary search tree to get the elements in sorted order. 

Complexity: O(n^2)

# Permutation Sort or Bogo Sort
BogoSort also known as permutation sort, stupid sort, slow sort, shotgun sort or monkey sort is a particularly ineffective algorithm as one person can ever imagine. It is based on generate and test paradigm. The algorithm successively generates permutations of its input until it finds one that is sorted.

Complexity: O(n*n!)

# Cocktail Sort
Cocktail Sort is a variation of Bubble sort. The Bubble sort algorithm always traverses elements from left and moves the largest element to its correct position in the first iteration and second-largest in the second iteration and so on. Cocktail Sort traverses through a given array in both directions alternatively. Cocktail sort does not go through the unnecessary iteration making it efficient for large arrays.

Complexity: O(n^2)

# Strand Sort
Strand sort is a recursive sorting algorithm that sorts items of a list into increasing order. It has O(nÂ²) worst time complexity which occurs when the input list is reverse sorted. It has a best case time complexity of O(n) which occurs when the input is a list that is already sorted.

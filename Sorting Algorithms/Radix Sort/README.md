# Radix Sort
Radix Sort is a linear sorting algorithm that sorts elements by processing them digit by digit. It is an efficient sorting algorithm for integers or strings with fixed-size keys. 

Complexity: Radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping the keys by the individual digits which share the same significant position and value. It has a time complexity of O(d * (n + b)), where d is the number of digits, n is the number of elements, and b is the base of the number system being used.
